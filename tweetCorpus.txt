0	In Atlanta, an anonymous group of activists with roots in the Occupy movement has set up http://AtlantaAgainstAmazon.org , a website that compares the HQ2 process to “something like a televised Hunger Games death-match” #NoHQ2 #AmazonHQ2 #FuckAmazon
0	With one tweet, @caseycagle has torpedoed whatever chance #Atlanta might have had with #Amazonhq2
0	Great debate on whether Atlanta could deal with 11 more mins of traffic for #AmazonHQ2. This is just a snippet. Things really got heated when @chesley11alive started talking. Hopefully you caught #MorningRushATL today. Happy almost Friday!
1	.@CNBC of all places has put together an interesting ranking of #AmazonHQ2 cities. NY, Atlanta & Chicago top 3. DC, Boston & Toronto further down the list: https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/19/ok-amazon-here-are-some-cities-you-should-consider-calling-home.
1	What's your bet for home city for #AmazonHQ2? Paddy Power puts 2-1 odds on #Atlanta
1	Let's bring #AmazonHQ2 to the only city of choice...#Atlanta. Our city is Top choice. #retweet if you agree. #blogger
0	Our traffic already sucks. Can you fix it? Otherwise, nevermind
0	Hey @amazon, please stay the hell out of Austin. We don't want you to ruin us like you ruined Seattle. #AmazonHQ2
0	#Austin lawmakers are hiding their bid for #AmazonHQ2. Is it because they know that those millions of dollars should be going to the struggling public school system? #NoToAmazonHQ2
1	Amazon commercial mentioned the weather in Austin. They're moving here. It's over.
1	If @amazon is really data driven, #Austin should be the city for Amazon's $5 billion HQ2 #AmazonHQ2
1	Moody’s put Austin at No. 1 to win #AmazonHQ2
0	This is an underdiscussed part of the problem with the possibility of #AmazonHQ2 coming to Boston: Amazon would exert outsize control over city and state politics.
0	Throwing money at Amazon will solve none of Boston's problems and just create more. #AmazonHQ2 #NoAmazonInBoston
0	Sliver lining? Tea leafs suggests Boston out of the running for Amazon's HQ2. If Boston, it would ignite an immediate increase in already sky-high rents and home prices
1	Rooting for the #AmazonHQ2 proposals from #Boston and #UnionPoint in #Weymouth today! #jobs #build
1	It could be that I live in Boston, but I really think Boston has a decent chance of getting #AmazonHQ2
1	Robot predicts #Boston will win #AmazonHQ2.
0	Money for kids and education, no  handouts for corporations #AmazonHQ2 #twill #chicago
0	Will Chicago's #AmazonHQ2 bid come at a cost to public transit?
0	In January we sued the City of Chicago to publicly release the #AmazonHQ2 bid. The public should know what incentives the city is offering amazon.
1	EDITORIAL: Chicago is Jeff Bezos’ kind of town, though he may not yet know it. #AmazonHQ2
1	@ChicagolandCmbr President and CEO Lavin: "As the voice of our region’s business community, we stand ready to dig deeper and show Amazon that #Chicago is the greatest city to live and work."
1	proud to be supporting Chicago's efforts for #AmazonHQ2 - check out this amazing video we submitted with our bid - thanks for the voice over
0	#Columbus could be giving our schools the money the need, but is instead promising billions of dollars for #AmazonHQ2. #NoToAmazonHQ2
0	Was bored and crunching rough numbers and it's laughable the 'density' that Columbus has compared to cities it compares itself to. Building strip malls and annexing farmland for subdivisions isn't a city, it's a suburb trying to claim a city title. Have fun with that, #AmazonHQ2
0	Lest we forget, the same sheriff's office that killed #JosephHaynes has been accused of torture in the county jail by the UN. #Columbus #opportunitycity #smartcity #AmazonHQ2
1	Columbus is centrally located, has high-quality higher education, a large and talented workforce, robust transportation infrastructure, and a business-friendly environment. In other words, it's the perfect place for #AmazonHQ2.
1	Come on @amazon just choose Columbus. We promise you’ll like it here. #ohio #ColumbusOhio #AmazonHQ2
1	Columbus is open for business. Proud to lead the #Ohio delegation letter urging @amazon to select Cbus for its #AmazonHQ2:
0	Dear @amazon - #Dallas is full! Please look elsewhere for new #AmazonHQ2
0	1. More from @profgalloway on #AmazonHQ2: "Dallas… you’re done. You have good universities, but not enough of them, and Amazon needs an Amazonian pipeline of the best and brightest to support its growth."
0	You can say Dallas and Texas is better than this, but clearly not. Don't be confused when #AmazonHQ2 doesn't come here. #txlege
1	Excited the DFW Region made #AmazonHQ2 Top 20 list. #DFW is a PRIME location for @amazon's new headquarters! Extremely proud of all the hard work @FTWChamber, @RobSturns, @Gengelbach & @DRChamber put in to showcasing Dallas-Fort Worth & all it has to offer.
1	#Dallas made the cut for #AmazonHQ2! Meets the business requirements beautifully and has great #BBQ to boot! Just sayin @Amazon
1	Not sure if @JeffBezos coming to @SMU this spring has anything to do with Dallas being on the finalist list for @amazon HQ2, but we're hoping it does! Maybe he heard about us having 40% of tech jobs in Texas , either way we're excited. #engineering #AmazonHQ2 #Dallas #SMU
0	How does Denver rank against the 19 other finalists in the #AmazonHQ2 competition? Not even in the top half when it comes to public transportation, STEM graduates and incoming housing.
0	Please #amazonhq2, don't bring 50k more people to Denver. We're full. Really full.
0	#AmazonHQ2 is probably headed to one of these 5 cities, says our data. And none of them is Denver, @NYTimes. #Amazon
1	Hello #AmazonHQ2 . #NY Times thinks Denver is the best location, so do we.
1	Denver seems like a serious candidate. Good education, great quality of life, Int. airport. Convenient location in the middle. #AmazonHQ2
1	.@UpshotNYT picks #Denver for #AmazonHQ2
0	#AmazonHQ2 protest grows: Indianapolis Councilman Jared Evans: I’m absolutely against this process that Amazon has created, and what from my perception looks like they want every city and state to basically hand over” massive tax breaks, @jwjnational @P4Wf
0	“I’m not sure if taxpayers are OK with this anymore,” Indianapolis Councilman Jared Evans said. “How much are we really willing to put toward [#AmazonHQ2] when we don’t even have the appropriate funding for our infrastructure and our roads?”
0	if @amazon is serious about public transport and traffic issues, then we can eliminate: Atlanta, Miami, Columbus, Mont. County, N. Virginia, Denver, Austin, Dallas, Indianapolis. all have horrendous traffic or terrible public transport policy. #AmazonHQ2
1	Hey @amazon... Indianapolis is an absolutely magical place. Can't wait to be neighbors with you #AmazonHQ2
1	Good story. It is not a surprise for those who know Indianapolis. Emerging city with young entrepreneurs and quality of life. #AmazonHQ2
1	“Amazon can grow here in a way they can’t grow in other places.” -@IndyChamber CEO Michael Huber today on #amazonhq2 coming to #indianapolis.
0	I don’t think LA will get #AmazonHQ2 The City doesn’t have good enough public transportation.
0	No #AmazonHQ2 in LA, it's a horrible company, bad for workers, neoliberal capitalism at its worst. #BoycottAmazon
0	Yes, please flood LA with more traffic and an additional 50,000+ residents who will drive up rent even further. Besides, where are you gonna put it? Carson? Whatever neighborhood you stick it in will be forever ruined. #AmazonHQ2
1	As home to over 900 #Startups, LA's #Tech scene is a strong #AmazonHQ2 competitor!
1	Thrilled to see Los Angeles on the short list for #AmazonHQ2. West Valley is the perfect location for Amazon’s second home and I am eager to show @JeffBezos all our community has to offer.
1	With our new #LA office, we'd be thrilled to see the new #Amazon headquarters land in Los Angeles! #HQ2 #AmazonHQ2
0	personally if they announce #AmazonHQ2 is in Miami i am packed and out the door the next day. #serverless has been too #beachless to date.
0	Miami remains a long shot for Amazon's first corporate office park outside Seattle. #AmazonHQ2
0	#miami trails badly in the tussle for #amazonhq2 as the city is not listed among the top contenders in latest ranking by #wallstreetjournal. Via Miami Herald
1	With its business friendly environment, hard workers, and beautiful beaches #Miami would be a great place for @Amazon’s next headquarters. Glad to see it’s a finalist for #AmazonHQ2.
1	When I think of what's possible, I think of Miami. This is a city whose diversity is one of its greatest strengths. We are a global hub of talent and innovation. Great news that @amazon is considering Miami for #AmazonHQ2
1	Amazon -- I think Will Smith said it best, "Welcome to Miami and Bienvenido a Miami.” After all, with diversity, great schools, beautiful weather, and low taxes who wouldn't want to call Miami home? @amazon @jeffbezos #AmazonHQ2
0	MuckRock requested Montgomery County's #AmazonHQ2 bid back in November 2017 - you can read the full release, including the 10 redacted pages of "additional incentives" here:
0	on #AmazonHQ2, Montgomery County resident says: “This is like a reverse lottery. Those who win have to pay."
0	#MoCoFY19 Robert Goldman of Montgomery housing partnership decries affordable housing crisis in MoCo. Arrival of #AmazonHQ2 will deeply worsen this unless we have a specific strategy
1	Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan: 'Really good chance' new @Amazon headquarters will come to Montgomery County
1	As speaker Busch said, "if Montgomery County succeeds, so does the rest of MD". #AmazonHQ2 #MetroFunding
1	I couldn’t agree more! I hope Amazon is taking a close look at Montgomery County’s award winning park system! #AmazonHQ2
0	Nashville needs to lose on the #AmazonHQ2 deal. It's time to pause Music City growth before we suffocate ourselves.
0	#Nashville residents can look forward to paying maybe $400 more in rent per month if #AmazonHQ2 comes to town -- can our communities afford that spike?
0	Nashville has made it as one of the top spots for #AmazonHQ2 . It would be great for @amazon to put it here because we are centrally located for mid and eastern US states. Perfect spot!
1	#Nashville is a city in the rise! Excited to be here a d be a part of it #AmazonHQ2
1	Of all the cities in top 20, Nashville TN has the lowest unemployment rate. #AmazonHQ2
1	I think odds of #Nashville as #AmazonHQ2 skyrocketed after news of #healthcare partnership of Amazon, JPMorgan, Berkshire Hathaway. It's the epicenter of private HC biz. Emerging city open to outside influence. Academic institutions. Now, to solve #Nashvilletransit puzzle...
0	.@amazon continues to treat New Jersey like its piggybank by grabbing $39 million in corporate welfare since 2000, and now wants billions of dollars from taxpayers for #AmazonHQ2 in #Newark, writes our Robert B. Engel. It’s time to tell lawmakers no more #PrimeOnOurDime.
0	Our #OPRA request for Newark's #AmazonHQ2 bid was denied today, nearly 3 months after it was submitted - even though the bid entails the awarding of billions in public dollars. RT if you agree that it's time to #EndSubsidySecrecy
0	@AmyKup re: WATCH: 'SNL' casts doubt on Newark as Amazon HQ2 candidate: http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2018/01/snl_amazon_hq2_skit_newark_cory_booker.html …
1	.@CityofNewarkNJ finalizes $2 billion in local incentives for @amazon | “The City Council has brought #Newark a giant step closer to being Amazon’s choice for #HQ2 with final passage of these ordinances.” -- Mayor @rasjbaraka
1	From day 1, Newark has makes an incredible amount of sense for #AmazonHQ2 for one reason; it's the largest shipping container port in the United States. More important the constant talk of tech talent and jobs; @amazon is an enormous global logistics company. Newark is perfect.
1	@JeffBezos #AmazonHQ2 I'm 100% confident that NJ is the place. Teterboro & Newark airport. NJ rail to NYC. 1000's of apts under construction
0	#AmazonHQ2 is looking for a lot more space. Maybe New York should step back and let another city take this one.
0	But it's not clear traffic really matters to #Amazon. New York? #AmazonHQ2 @RTATriangle
0	Also if 50,000 more subway riders suddenly descended on NYC with #AmazonHQ2 the L train's head might explode.
1	Incredibly happy to see #NYC is a finalist for #AmazonHQ2! NYC has so much to offer @amazon & all tech companies looking for new talent & opportunities https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/technology/amazon-finalists-headquarters.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur …
1	With our commitment to market-based #CleanEnergy innovation, New York is also the perfect place to grow your business while shrinking your carbon footprint. #Rev4NY #AmazonHQ2
1	NYC has the best and brightest workforce in the nation - the most important asset for any company and the reason why NYC is the best contender for #AmazonHQ2.
0	To lure #AmazonHQ2, Northern Virginia promises taxpayer-funded “incentive” packages. Deals like this stick taxpayers on the losing end.
0	Great listen from @allyschweitzer as she explains why #AmazonHQ2 would end up being a ripoff for taxpayers in northern Virginia https://wbur.fm/2vHDd1S  #NoToAmazonHQ2
0	In a democracy, taxpayers should have a say on how their tax dollars are spent. But in the #AmazonHQ2 bidding war, leaders in Virginia are racing to give away untold billions in tax dollars with ZERO public input.
1	Fascinating re: clusters! Also because Northern Virginia tax rates have not gone up in 40 years... STILL sitting at 6%. Hellloooo Virginia! #technology #Amazon #AmazonHQ2
1	Insiders are buzzing that Northern Virginia could soon be awarded @Amazon's HQ2 as Jeff Bezos makes high-profile visit 
1	Reasons why Amazon should relocate to Tysons/Northern Virginia = Silver Line, Dulles Tech Corridor, (3) airports in region. #AmazonHQ2 #hq2
0	Pennsylvania is keeping the #Philadelphia bid for #AmazonHQ2 a secret, but we know that the state has given away the most in corporate welfare nationwide over the last decade. #NoToAmazonHQ2 pic.twitter.com/SnIpFVB6FA
0	Reminder that while Philadelphia is raising taxes on the middle class, the City is offering billions in tax cuts to get #AmazonHQ2... because Bezos needs the help. You know. Happy #PrimeDay!
0	Philadelphia has committed to fully funding public schools. How can we do that while giving billions in tax breaks to Amazon? #12DaysOfRawDeals #AmazonHQ2 @powerinterfaith @KatiSipp
1	"If I were Bezos, I’d choose Philadelphia" https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-09-12/dc-needs-amazon-but-amazon-can-do-better?utm_campaign=news&utm_medium=bd&utm_source=applenews … #AmazonHQ2
1	"People want to be in Philly. It’s a city on the rise. When you start putting smart, motivated people together in the same place good things happen." — @tewksbum from @Buildbetterbots on #AmazonHQ2 in #Philadelphia
1	Very interesting! #PhillyDelivers #AmazonHQ2 - "Dartmouth professor says Philadelphia is best choice for HQ2" https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2018/01/21/dartmouth-professor-says-philadelphia-is-best.html … via @PHLBizJournal
0	pittsburgh residents with @Pittsburghersfo are at #p4pgh18 to oppose @amazon #amazonhq2 & @billpeduto’s lack of transparency re tax breaks & incentives for the corporation
0	Jeff Bezos is a billionaire, but can't pay workers a fair wage. We don't need more employers like this in #Pittsburgh NO #AmazonHQ2
0	When tech companies like Google and Uber set up shop in Pittsburgh, housing costs skyrocketed. Working people feel #AmazonHQ2 would only serve to exacerbate the problem
1	BIG NEWS! @amazon is expanding in #Pittsburgh, will more than double their current workforce in the Steel City. Could #AmazonHQ2 be next? http://cbsloc.al/2C7ZCef
1	Investor buys 18 Hazelwood properties near potential #AmazonHQ2 site should Pittsburgh be selected. http://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2018/01/26/Developer-buys-18-Hazelwood-properties-near-potential-Amazon-site/stories/201801250199 … via @PittsburghPG
1	We continue to believe there is no region in the country better suited to support and benefit from Amazon's continued growth, says @PNCBank via @PBT_Lian at @PghBizTimes. #AmazonHQ2 #Pittsburgh
0	While there are great people here it was hard enough hiring for a small startup, I predict the odds of Raleigh being a #AmazonHQ2 city being slim. 50k people is a LOT to hire and it would be nice to hire from an area with more public web and ecommerce companies. Also: no transit
0	To win #AmazonHQ2, Raleigh offers big giveaways with our tax dollars, North Carolinians deserve better than to see their hard-earned $$$ go to giant corporations.
0	Why are #Raleigh lawmakers hiding how many millions of dollars they promised for #AmazonHQ2? Is it because they know it should be going to funding our public schools? #NoToAmazonHQ2 pic.twitter.com/gtuVNtXaig
1	I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Raleigh will end up with #AmazonHQ2. The triangle is a major tech hub. We have Citrix, Red Hat, Cisco, SAS, IBM, & many more. People tend to forget that Amazon isn't just shopping. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a major cloud platform.
1	No surprise. If you don’t know Raleigh is a top market, you don’t know much. #919toMLS #AmazonHQ2 https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/01/18/amazon-names-top-20-finalists-second-headquarters-race/1040710001/ …
1	With a robust and diverse local economy, broad talent pool, fantastic public education system, local investments in transit, the arts, and open space - all in a central location with a beautiful climate and room to grow, Raleigh & Wake County are #PrimeForAmazon. #AmazonHQ2
0	Before Toronto starts picking out wallpaper for #AmazonHQ2...it's dead last in one important factor: housing affordability.
0	Toronto, we need to find ways to ensure #startups are benefitting instead of losing talent to the new HQ2. My thoughts on #AmazonHQ2 with @BNN: http://bit.ly/2DMe9dH
0	#AmazonHQ2 is not going to end up in Toronto guys. Despite the attractiveness, the tax incentives alone will keep Bezos in the U.S.
1	Great summary of the Toronto bid for #AmazonHQ2 explained in this NYTimes article. Our talent pipeline and Postsecondary institutions are key. Universities are important partners in creating a better future for our students, communities and the province.
1	The best part about #Toronto's #AmazonHQ2 bid? It doesn't include #taxbreaks. Instead, it focuses on our city and province's incredible #talent, #education, and #health. These are incentives in themselves, and what makes us a great place to do business! #TOpoli #ONpoli #HQ2
1	The experts are learning what we have known for a long time - more companies are seeing Toronto as a world leader for tech sector investment, jobs, and innovation. Proud our Amazon bid is helping show Toronto to the world! #AmazonHQ2 #TOtech
0	Northern Virginia offers a premier location for business growth, but @ArlChamberVA needs to consider the hidden costs that bringing #AmazonHQ2 would have on #Arlington communities. #NoToAmazonHQ2
0	Demands to #EndSubsidySecrecy Expand: Arlington VA citizens demand transparency as local governments offer deals to win #AmazonHQ2 |
0	Are we offering special deals to mega-corporation Amazon? Our county budget is tight with schools and metro issues: Arlington GOP demands more info about county’s bid for #AmazonHQ2.
1	“Whatever decision @amazon makes about the location for #AmazonHQ2, their consideration of Arlington means that the national spotlight has found Arlington county - our excellent workforce, talent, education, and resources” -@kcristol
1	so #Arlington #VA is third best city for #Millennials (interestingly @NicheSocial defines as 25-34) https://www.arlnow.com/2018/03/08/arlington-no-3-on-new-best-cities-for-millennials-list/ … #DC #NoVA #AmazonHQ2
1	Amazon employees just accidentally dropped a big clue about where the new headquarters could be #AmazonHQ2 #Arlington #VA #business #Amazon
